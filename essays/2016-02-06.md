I am currently completing my 3rd and final year in the Computer Engineering Technology program at Algonquin College. Looking to gain 
an opportunity to be challenged, grow as a developer, and continue to gain knowledge and stay up to date in the continuously technology growing world.

Throughout school I have been given many tools, skills and thinking patterns to be a successful and efficient employee in the workplace.
Accompanied with the many skills and character building traits that I have gained from multiple forms of work, among them serving in the 
Canadian Armed Forces as a reservist in the infantry. Among these many fields of work I aspired to focus on gaining knowledge and skillset from each job, these skills will follow me throughout my life and allow me to apply them to future projects. 

With this portfolio, I plan to find opportunity to gain experience related to the IT Industry. If you would like to follow up with me to discuss my qualifications and learn more about me. I can be contacted personally at ngdaigle@gmail.com. Thank you for your time and consideration.
